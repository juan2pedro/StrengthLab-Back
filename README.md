# StrengthLab 🏋️‍♂️

**Strength Training Management Platform (MVP)**

StrengthLab is a specialized web application designed for strength athletes and coaches, focused on **Powerlifting programming** and **Conjugate Method training systems**.

The goal of this project is to model complex training programming structures while providing a clean and scalable backend architecture.

This repository showcases a **production-style backend architecture** using modern Java and Spring Boot technologies.

# 🚀 Core Features

## Exercise Management

Create and manage a structured catalog of exercises including:

- movement pattern
- implement
- stance / grip
- loading method
- height adjustments

This allows modelling **exercise variations commonly used in strength training**.

---

## Training Program Templates

Define structured programming blocks:

Block → Week → Day → Prescribed Sets

Each template can define:

- target sets
- reps
- intensity (RPE / % / RIR)
- rest time
- exercise variations

---

## Workout Execution

Generate real workout sessions from templates and record:

- performed sets
- weight used
- reps completed
- intensity (RPE / RIR)

Each set is stored individually to allow **fine-grained performance tracking**.

---

## Training History

Retrieve past workouts by:

- workout id
- date
- date ranges

This allows athletes to review past sessions and track performance evolution.

# 🏗 Architecture

The backend follows a **layered architecture** with clear separation of responsibilities:

Controller → Service → Repository → Database

DTO ↔ Entity mapping handled via **MapStruct**.

### Architectural Principles

- Entities are **never exposed directly**
- DTOs are used for all API responses
- Aggregates are loaded efficiently to avoid N+1 queries
- Mapping logic is centralized with **MapStruct**
- REST endpoints follow consistent resource hierarchies

Example endpoints:

/api/workouts/{workoutId}
/api/workouts/by-date?date=YYYY-MM-DD
/api/exercises
/api/templates

---

# 🧠 Domain Model Overview

Core aggregates:

Exercise

TrainingSessionTemplate
└── TrainingSetTemplate

WorkoutSession
└── WorkoutEntry
└── WorkoutSet

This structure allows modelling:

- prescribed training
- executed training
- performance metrics
